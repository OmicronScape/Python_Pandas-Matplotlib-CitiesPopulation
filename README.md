# Python_Pandas-Matplotlib-CitiesPopulation
Visualizing European city populations using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.


European City Population Analysis

This project is a Python script designed to help you explore and visualize population data for European cities. It's built for anyone who wants to quickly understand population trends, whether you're a data enthusiast, a student, or just curious.
What to Expect from This Code

This script uses powerful Python libraries like Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical tasks, and Matplotlib for creating clear, informative charts. Here's a breakdown of what you can do and learn:

  Effortless Data Loading: The code can easily read city and population data from a standard CSV file (like an Excel sheet), focusing on just the city, country, and population columns.
  Population Summaries:
      Total Population by Country: Quickly get the sum of all city populations for each country in your dataset. This gives you an instant overview of urban population distribution across Europe.
      Largest City per Country: Identify the most populous city in each country. This is great for understanding urban centers at a glance.
      Overall Total Population: Get a grand total of the population for all cities included in your dataset.
  Clear Visualizations:
      Population Pie Chart: See the population distribution across countries at a glance. The chart smartly groups smaller populations into an "Rest of Europe" category to keep things tidy and easy to read.
      Largest Cities Bar Chart: Compare the populations of the largest cities in each country side-by-side using a simple bar chart.
  User-Friendly Menu: The script provides an interactive menu right in your terminal. You can choose different analysis options and generate charts without needing to touch the code itself. Just run the script and follow the prompts!

How to Get Started

  Python Installation: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
  Required Libraries: This project relies on pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. If you don't have them, you can install them easily using pip:
  Bash

  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

  The Data File: You'll need a CSV file named european_cities.csv (or similar, just adjust the filename variable in main()) containing city, country, and population data. Make sure its path is correctly set in the main function.
  Run the Script:
      Save the code as a Python file (e.g., population_analyzer.py).
      Open your terminal or command prompt.
      Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
      Run the command: python population_analyzer.py

Once running, the interactive menu will guide you through the available options.

This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in data analysis and visualization with Python, offering practical examples of how to use these powerful libraries.
